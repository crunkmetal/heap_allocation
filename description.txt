  Calculating Your Car's Miles per Gallon (MPG)

  FILL UP AND RECORD
  - Fill up your gas tank all the way.
  - If your car has a trip odometer - reset it.
    - OR record the master odometer mileage.
  - Drive your car as you normally would and...
    - after using at least half a tank of gas...
  - Get to the gas station and fill your tank again.
  - Record the amount of gas it took to refill the tank.
  - Record the price per gallon of gas.
  - Record the elapsed trip miles on trip odometer
    - or record the new odometer mileage.

  CALCULATE
  - Subtract the original odometer reading from the new one.
  - Divide the miles traveled by the amount of gallons
    - it took to refill the tank. 
  - The result will be your carâ€™s average MPG 
    - (miles per gallon) yield for that driving period.

  Here's the formula: miles driven/gallons used = MPG
